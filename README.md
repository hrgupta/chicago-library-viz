# Chicago Library Visualization

This is an example of how to deploy a vega-lite visualization to github pages directly.

It uses CDNs for delivering the javascript, and builds on these libraries:

* [vega-lite](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/)
* [less.js](http://lesscss.org/)

We will be using Chicago Library dataset and will be transforming the dataset according to vega-lite specification.
