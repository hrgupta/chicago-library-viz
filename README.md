# Example vega-lite repository

This is an example of how to deploy a vega-lite visualization to github pages directly.

It uses CDNs for delivering the javascript, and builds on these libraries:

* [vega-lite](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/)
* [less.js](http://lesscss.org/)

We will add more as the semester continues.
